## Working with databases

The resources in this repository are intended to help instructors and students move from working with data in files and R data frames to working with data in databases.

### Getting Started

[SQLite-GettingStarted.Rmd](SQLite-GettingStarted.Rmd) will walk you through 

 * installing and loading the necessary R packages
 * creating  a simple SQLite database (containing four tables) on your local machine.  
 
The data are a subset of a much larger database of airline delays.  
Each of these tables is stored as a CSV.  The result is a modestly sized data base
with which one can learn basic data base operations in R.
